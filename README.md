Front End Web Development Personal Portfolio

This portfolio is used to display the front-end web development work of Stephen Prager. Initially developed as Project #1 for the Udacity Front-End NanoDegree, the portfolio will grow as I complete more projects over the duration of the course.

__Directory__

index.html -> Holds all text markup for the portfolio page
./img -> Used to store all images used in the portfolio
./css -> Used to store all CSS files used in styling the portfolio. Currently there are two:
       1) styles.css -> Holds core CSS styling
       2) responsive.css -> Holds media queries used to make the portfolio page responsive for phones / tablets
